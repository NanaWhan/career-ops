  <em>I spent months applying to jobs the hard way. So I engineered the system I wish I had.</em><br>
  Companies use AI to filter candidates. <strong>I gave candidates AI to <em>choose</em> companies.</strong><br>
  <em>Now it's open source.</em>

## What Is This

Career-Ops turns any AI coding CLI into a full job search command center. Instead of manually tracking applications in a spreadsheet, you get an AI-powered pipeline that:

- **Evaluates offers** with a structured A-F scoring system (10 weighted dimensions)
- **Generates tailored PDFs** -- ATS-optimized CVs customized per job description
- **Scans portals** automatically (Greenhouse, Ashby, Lever, company pages)
- **Processes in batch** -- evaluate 10+ offers in parallel with sub-agents
- **Tracks everything** in a single source of truth with integrity checks

> **Important: This is NOT a spray-and-pray tool.** Career-ops is a filter -- it helps you find the few offers worth your time out of hundreds. The system strongly recommends against applying to anything scoring below 4.0/5. Your time is valuable, and so is the recruiter's. Always review before submitting.

Career-ops is agentic: Claude Code navigates career pages with Playwright, evaluates fit by reasoning about your CV vs the job description (not keyword matching), and adapts your resume per listing.

> **Heads up: the first evaluations won't be great.** The system doesn't know you yet. Feed it context -- your CV, your career story, your proof points, your preferences, what you're good at, what you want to avoid. The more you nurture it, the better it gets. Think of it as onboarding a new recruiter: the first week they need to learn about you, then they become invaluable.

Built by someone who used it to evaluate 740+ job offers, generate 100+ tailored CVs, and land a Head of Applied AI role. [Read the full case study](https://santifer.io/career-ops-system).

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/NanaWhan/career-ops.git
cd career-ops && npm install
npx playwright install chromium   # Required for PDF generation
```

**That's it. Claude sets everything else up for you.**

```bash
# 2. Open Claude Code in this directory
claude

# Claude will automatically detect that you haven't set up your profile yet
# and walk you through onboarding step by step:
#   → Paste your CV (or describe your experience)
#   → Answer a few questions about your target roles and preferences
#   → Claude creates config/profile.yml, portals.yml, and data/applications.md
#
# Then just paste any job URL to evaluate your first offer.
```

> **The system is designed to be customized by Claude itself.** Archetypes, scoring weights, negotiation scripts, company lists, portals — just tell Claude what you want to change. It reads the same files it uses, so it knows exactly what to edit.
>
> Common customizations:
> - "My target stack is Node.js and TypeScript" → updates portals.yml + profile
> - "I'm based in [country], only looking for globally-open remote roles" → updates deal-breakers and filters
> - "Add these 5 companies to my scanner" → updates portals.yml
> - "Update my profile with this CV I'm pasting" → updates cv.md and config

See [docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md) for the full setup guide.

## Usage

Career-ops is a single slash command with multiple modes:

```
/career-ops                → Show all available commands
/career-ops {paste a JD}   → Full auto-pipeline (evaluate + PDF + tracker)
/career-ops scan           → Scan portals for new offers
/career-ops pdf            → Generate ATS-optimized CV
/career-ops batch          → Batch evaluate multiple offers
/career-ops tracker        → View application status
/career-ops apply          → Fill application forms with AI
/career-ops pipeline       → Process pending URLs
/career-ops contacto       → LinkedIn outreach message
/career-ops deep           → Deep company research
/career-ops training       → Evaluate a course/cert
/career-ops project        → Evaluate a portfolio project
```

Or just paste a job URL or description directly -- career-ops auto-detects it and runs the full pipeline.

## Pre-configured Portals

The scanner comes with **25+ companies** ready to scan, organized by global hiring track record, and **14 search queries** on job boards that serve worldwide remote candidates.

**Globally distributed (hire on every continent):** GitLab, Automattic, Grafana Labs, Doist, Buffer, Elastic, MongoDB, Netlify, Hotjar, Help Scout
**African tech (Africa-based or Africa-friendly):** Flutterwave, Paystack, Wave, Chipper Cash, Andela, Kuda Bank, Mono, Stitch
**Large companies with international programs:** Datadog, Twilio, Cloudflare, Stripe, Zapier
**Remote-first dev tools:** Supabase, Fly.io, Neon, Turso

**Job boards searched:** We Work Remotely (worldwide), Remotive, Arc.dev, Jobgether, Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby

> **About global remote filtering:** The scanner pre-screens each listing for global eligibility — roles restricted to US/EU residents are flagged and skipped automatically. Every company in the default config has been verified to have a global or Africa-friendly hiring track record.
>
> Want different companies? Just tell Claude: "Add [company] to my portals" or "Replace this list with companies in the fintech space." Claude edits portals.yml directly.

## Dashboard TUI

The built-in terminal dashboard lets you browse your pipeline visually:

```bash
cd dashboard
go build -o career-dashboard .
./career-dashboard --path ..
```

Features: 6 filter tabs, 4 sort modes, grouped/flat view, lazy-loaded previews, inline status changes.

## About

This is a fork of [santifer/career-ops](https://github.com/santifer/career-ops) — an open-source AI job search pipeline originally built by [Santiago](https://santifer.io) to evaluate 740+ job offers and land a Head of Applied AI role. Full credit to the original author for the system design, evaluation logic, and tooling.

**This fork is maintained by [Cherish Banini Seinty](https://cherishseinty.dev)** — Lead Software Engineer specializing in distributed systems, defense-grade platforms, and AI-integrated products. Based in Accra, Ghana. Working remotely with global teams.

**What's different in this fork:**
- Portal scanner rebuilt for globally-open remote roles (no US/EU-only companies)
- Pre-screening step filters out listings that require local work authorization
- African tech companies added (Flutterwave, Paystack, Wave, Chipper Cash, and more)
- Global remote job boards added (We Work Remotely, Remotive, Arc.dev, Jobgether)
- Profile and archetypes tuned for Backend / Full-Stack engineering roles

It works for anyone, anywhere. If the default company list doesn't match your career, just tell Claude to change it — that's what this system is built for.
